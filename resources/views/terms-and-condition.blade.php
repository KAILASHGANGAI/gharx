            <h1>What to include in Terms and Conditions for online stores ?</h1>
            <p>Terms and Conditions are fundamental to mount an adequate and proper defense, should the need arise. To protect your online store in a preventative way, a good Terms and Conditions document should contain the following clauses:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> Identification of the business (seller contact details) </li>
                <li>Description of the service that your site/app provides</li>
                <li>Information on risk allocation, liability, and disclaimers</li>
                <li>Warranty/Guarantee information (where applicable)</li>
                <li>The existence of a withdrawal right (if applicable)</li>
                <li>Terms of delivery of product/service</li>
                <li>Conditions of use/purchase (e.g. age requirements, location-based restrictions)</li>
                    <li>Info related to methods of payments</li>
                </li>
            </ul>
